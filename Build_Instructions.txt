(note this will build to support the machine's OS --linux is unteseted -- that you are on... pretty much)

"pyinstaller --windowed --onefile guiRunner.py"

Note: you will need pyinstaller installed, use the following if an error occurs, then try the above:

"pip3 install pyinstaller"

This should output an executable in the directory that you are currently in (and some other stuff that can be deleted)
The executable is standalone and can be distributed
